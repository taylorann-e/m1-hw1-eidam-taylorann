## About Me
I love the ocean, sports, my family, and my faith! I am up for a challenge but need to be shown with examples in person.

## Past Coding Experience 
In the third grade I did the angry birds teaching courses, but that is all about my coding experience. It feels like a foreign language to me, however I am determined to practice it to where it becomes fluent.

## Career Goals
1. Finish Bachelor's degree in 3.5 years
2. Finish Master's in 1.5 years
3. Obtain job or internship in sports industry running social media for a professional team. I am also open to internships outside of sports to give me more of a perspective on what I actually enjoy doing. 
4. Anything creative and design like I am passionate about! I also would love a family some day.
